  "コマ割り (komawari / panel-division) design — proposes panel geometry
  (:panel/rect :panel/tilt :panel/polygon :panel/z :panel/bleed) for a page
  from an authored beat sequence.

  Encodes two classic manga composition techniques:

  1. Golden-ratio (φ≈1.618) proportional weighting instead of an even grid —
     a :large beat reads ~φ:1 against a :small one, so a page has a visual
     hierarchy rather than uniform boxes (`weight-of` / `beat-weight`).

  2. Force-line panel borders — when a row contains a :tension/:impact beat,
     the WHOLE ROW is sheared into parallelograms along that beat's
     :beat/vector (degrees), so the panel *frame* itself continues the
     action's diagonal across every gutter in the tier — not just the one
     panel, which would leave a wedge-shaped gap/overlap at its neighbors.
     Shearing every panel in the row by the same amount keeps every shared
     internal edge congruent (`row-tilt` / `shear-quad`).

  Both techniques are gated by a named `:style` (`styles`/`default-style`,
  ADR-2607051530): technique 2 above is the :toriyama preset. A :togashi
  preset instead keeps panels rectilinear (tilt off) and expresses dynamism
  through `:beat/inset` — a small reactive panel drawn overlapping the panel
  below it, panel-in-panel (`apply-inset`), tagged \"frame-break\" so the
  governor expects that specific overlap. ADR-2607172200 adds :araki
  (steeper shear caps + frame-break + `:beat/breakout` character bleed),
  :urasawa (rectilinear, subdued √φ weight table) and :inoue (rectilinear,
  character bleed, full-contrast φ table) — see the `styles` comment below
  for grounding.

  Pure/.cljc, no host interop — runs identically on the JVM, in SCI, and in
  a browser-side layout preview. Not the storage schema: callers merge the
  returned :panel/* keys onto their own panel maps (any other :panel/* key —
  :dialogue :visual :panel/id :panel/focal … — passes straight through)
  before persisting.

  Canonical home (ADR-2607141700): ported from `gftdcojp/ai-gftd-mangaka`'s
  `mangaka.layout.komawari` (ADR-2607051520/2607051530, where it was
  developed and proven against real Ghost Hacker Arc0-1 panels), landed here
  as the shared kotoba-lang package so `ai-gftd-mangaka`/`app-aozora` and any
  other `kami-mangaka-page` consumer (e.g. `kami-app-sip`) draw from one
  implementation instead of maintaining independent copies. `kami.mangaka.page`
  already carries a JVM/Java2D-specific tilt-only port (`komawari-tilt`,
  `row-tilt`, pixel-space `shear-polygon`) predating this file — that one
  stays as-is (it operates in Java2D pixel space on a different panel-map
  vocabulary, `:intensity`/`:vector` vs this namespace's `:beat/*`-prefixed
  beat vocabulary, and `kami-app-sip`'s `sip.page` facade depends on its
  existing `layout-page`/`template-for` API surface unchanged); this
  namespace is the fuller, normalized-space engine (proportional row/col
  band-splitting, named styles, panel-in-panel inset, the deterministic
  governor) that neither `page.clj`'s existing tilt-only port nor the old
  `template-for` grid templates implement.")

;; Named geometry presets (ADR-2607051530; expanded by ADR-2607172200), each

;; author-stated vs analyst consensus) live in ai-gftd-mangaka's
;; resources/komawari_styles.edn catalog.
;;
;; :toriyama — reference: DBZ panel-analysis stills. Dynamism lives in the
;;   PANEL FRAME: a tense/impact row is sheared into a parallelogram
;;   (`row-tilt`), reading as one continuous force-line across every panel in
;;   the tier. Panels stay edge-to-edge otherwise — no panel ever intrudes on
;;   its neighbor's territory.
;;
;; :togashi — reference: Hunter×Hunter 王位継承戦編 (冨樫義博). Panels stay
;;   RECTILINEAR even in tense exchanges (tilt disabled) — the dynamism
;;   instead lives in what's allowed to cross a panel's own border: a small
;;   reactive/gesture panel is drawn overlapping the larger panel beneath it
;;   (`:beat/inset`, tagged "frame-break" so the governor doesn't flag the
;;   deliberate overlap).
;;
;; :araki — reference: 『荒木飛呂彦の漫画術』 (page-turn discipline, every
;;   panel load-bearing — author-stated) + analyst consensus on JoJo's
;;   aggressive diagonal gutters, overlapping panels and figures breaking
;;   frames (NOT author-stated — the book's own 黄金比 is facial proportion,
;;   not panel weighting). Everything is allowed at once: steeper shear caps
;;   than :toriyama (45°/15° — a design choice bounding the observed
;;   steepness, not a sourced constant), frame-break insets AND character
;;   bleed-outs (`:beat/breakout`).
;;
;; :urasawa — reference: 浦沢直樹本人の言 (浦沢チャンネル「基本のキ」:
;;   見開き右上が要、コマ数は絞る; 小津安二郎サイトのインタビュー: 定点
;;   カメラの反復を自作に適用) + Benzilla layout analysis (水平バンド構造、
;;   ノド側に断ち切り無し). Panels stay rectilinear, no frame-break, no
;;   character bleed; size contrast is SUBDUED (√φ weight table — bands read
;;   as calm rhythm, the drama lives in repetition/page-turn, which are
;;   authoring-side devices, not geometry).
;;
;; :inoue — reference: SLAM DUNK 山王戦の無音シークエンス分析 (vol.31
;;   pp.91–154) + canmom panel/movement close-reading. Gutters stay
;;   rectilinear — the diagonal energy lives INSIDE the panel (action axis /
;;   speed lines), not in the frame — but figures cross panel borders
;;   (`:beat/breakout`) and size contrast is extreme (default φ table with
;;   splash = φ² for the frozen-moment payoff panels).

# kami-mangaka-page

Work-agnostic **graphic-novel PAGE composition** (komawari コマ割り + DTP) — the
Tier-1 `mangaka` platform page layer (ADR-2606282100).

Ported from `mangaka.gftd.ai`'s `manga-layouts.ts` `GRAPHIC_NOVEL_TEMPLATES`
(left-to-right reading). It places rendered panel images into a B5 page, draws
panel frames + gutters, and overlays dialogue as speech bubbles and narration as
caption boxes — turning isolated panels into a readable page.

Generic: a `page` is just `{:layout str :panels [{:id :size :narration :dialogue}…]}`
and `img-of` maps a panel-id → image `File` (or nil → placeholder). No story,
character, or world. JVM/Java2D **headless** — no Canvas-2D, no GPU (this is page
DTP, not the engine's wgpu render path).

Sibling crates: `kami-mangaka-render-clj` (2D panel prompts) and
`kami-mangaka-scene` / `kami-mangaka-scene-clj` (3D).

## Origin

Split out of `kotoba-lang/kami-engine`'s
[`kami-mangaka-page-clj/`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kami-engine/tree/main/kami-mangaka-page-clj)
subtree into its own standalone repo, following the same split pattern already
used for the sibling `kami-mangaka-genko-clj` → `kotoba-lang/kami-genko`. This is
a live, current Clojure project — it was never part of `kami-engine`'s deleted
Rust workspace (PR #82).

## API

```clojure
(require '[kami.mangaka.page :as page])

(page/template-for 4)          ; → 4-panel %-rect layout (falls back to a grid for n>9)
(page/layout-page page)        ; → {:bleed bool :pairs [[panel [x y w h]] …]} (ネーム-driven)
(page/compose-page! page img-of "out.png")   ; → writes a B5 PNG, returns the path
```

A work supplies `page` maps from its own storyboard and a panel-id→File resolver;
`kami-app-sip-clj`'s `sip.page` is the thin facade that wires `sip.storyboard`.

## `kami.mangaka.komawari` — golden-ratio panel geometry (ADR-2607141700)

A second, independent geometry engine lives alongside `page.clj`'s template/tilt
API above: `kami.mangaka.komawari`, a pure `.cljc` namespace with no Java2D/host
dependency. It proposes normalized `[0,1]` panel rects from an authored beat
sequence — proportional golden-ratio row/column weighting, force-line row-shear,
named `:toriyama`/`:togashi` artist styles, panel-in-panel frame-break inset, and
a deterministic overlap/bounds/tilt governor — rather than picking from a fixed
N-panel template.

```clojure
(require '[kami.mangaka.komawari :as komawari])

(komawari/propose-page-layout
  [[{:beat/weight :large :panel/id :hero} {:beat/weight :small :panel/id :bg}]]
  {:style :toriyama})
;; => [{:panel/id :hero :panel/rect [...]}
;;     {:panel/id :bg   :panel/rect [...]}]

(komawari/validate-layout panels)  ; => {:ok? bool :issues [...] :errors :warnings}
```

Ported from `gftdcojp/ai-gftd-mangaka`'s `mangaka.layout.komawari`
(ADR-2607051520/2607051530, developed and proven there against real Ghost
Hacker Arc0-1 panels) so it has one shared implementation instead of two
independent copies — `ai-gftd-mangaka` and `app-aozora` are expected to depend
on this namespace going forward rather than their own embedded copy.

## effectLines (効果線) & gaze (視線誘導)

Panels may carry the `ai.gftd.mangaka` page-lexicon fields `:effectLines` and
`:gaze`. Both use the **panel-local 0-1000 coordinate space** (both axes,
independent of the panel's pixel size — `{:centerX 480 :centerY 450}` = 48%
across / 45% down the panel rect).

```clojure
{:id "p1" :size "wide"
 ;; 効果線 — baked into the print image, clipped to the panel.
 ;; Z-order per the lexicon: panel art → tones → effectLines → SFX → bubbles.
 :effectLines [{:kind "focus" :centerX 480 :centerY 450 :density 44 :coverage 85}]
 ;; 視線誘導 — review-only metadata, never part of print output.
 :gaze {:entryX 850 :entryY 150 :focusX 480 :focusY 450
        :exitX 200 :exitY 700 :impression "dread"}}
```

- `:kind` — `focus`/`explosion` (radial black lines from the border toward the
  centre, leaving an inner clear radius derived from `:coverage`; `explosion`
  adds deterministic jitter + an irregular inner radius), `flash`
  (lighter-stroke radial burst), `speed` (parallel horizontal lines; optional
  `:direction` degrees). `:density` ≈ line count; unknown kinds are ignored.
- `:gaze` renders as a dashed red entry→focus→exit curve with an arrowhead,
  focus ring, and the `:impression` label — **only** when composing with the
  opt-in flag:

```clojure
(page/compose-page! page img-of "review.png" :gaze-overlay? true)
```

Without `:gaze-overlay? true` the output is byte-identical whether or not
`:gaze` is present.

## Test

```bash
clojure -M:test   # templates / layout (splash·grid·ネーム rows) / komawari propose+validate / headless compose-page!
clojure -M:lint   # clj-kondo, matches CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
```

`kami-mangaka-text` (the shared multilingual lettering dependency) is its own
standalone repo now (`:git/url`+`:sha` in `deps.edn`) — no sibling checkout or
monorepo-relative path needed to build.
